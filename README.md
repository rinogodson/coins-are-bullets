## Coins are Bullets


You're the superhero of your life!
You earn, spend, gain, or lose...
In this game, you need to collect Coins and use them as bullets against the Bills coming at you (you basically pay the bills).
When you pay a bill, you gain 1 Aura Point, and when you crash into a bill, you lose 3 Aura Points.
THE GOAL OF THE GAME IS: Don't let your Aura Points go negative.
Your score is determined by how long you survive.
